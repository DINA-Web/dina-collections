We have tried to define individual models so that it is clear how they should be be used. One of the biggest challenges in building a generic model is different cataloging practices. What a catalog number refers to can differ a lot between collections. To accommodate that variation, we have introduced a special model called <em>specimen</em>. Unlike the others, this model is extremely flexible: a specimen is simply the “things” you register under the same catalog number.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/current/models/individual/lid\">individual.lid</a></p>\n"
