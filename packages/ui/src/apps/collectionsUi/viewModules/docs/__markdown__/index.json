We have tried to define individual models<br>\nso that it is clear how they should be be used. One of the biggest challenges in<br>\nbuilding a generic model is different cataloging practices. What a catalog<br>\nnumber refers to can differ a lot between collections. To accommodate that<br>\nvariation, we have introduced a special model called <em>specimen</em>. Unlike the<br>\nothers, this model is extremely flexible: a specimen is simply the “things” you<br>\nregister under the same catalog number.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/docs/current/models/individual/lid\">individual.lid</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/images/dataModel.pdf\">&lt;img src=&quot;/images/dataModel.png&quot;/&gt;</a></p>\n"
