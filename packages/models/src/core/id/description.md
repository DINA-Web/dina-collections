# id

A resource identifier that in combination with a resource [type](__DOCLINK__type) identify a single unique resource. Resource identifiers are used in many places throughout the system. This concept is important for the functioning of the system, but less so for understanding the data model at a higher level.

For more information, see the [JSON:API documentation](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-identification).
