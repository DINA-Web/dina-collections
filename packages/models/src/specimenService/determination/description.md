# determination

A determination is a statement about an [individual's](__DOCLINK__individual/) taxon and/or type status, made by a person at a certain date. The outcome of a determination is usually a taxon name.


## Short description

A statement about an individual's taxon and/or type status.


### Definition

The act of making a statement about an [individual's](__DOCLINK__individual/) taxon and/or type status, which is not itself a type status designation.


### Examples

"Phoca hispida, det. by NN, 1957"


### Notes

A *type status designation* is understood here as an explicit or implicit designation of a new type status for a specimen with respect to a taxon name. A type status designation is a nomenclatural act made through a publication and strictly regulated by a nomenclatural code. The type status designation is the primary source of a specimen's type status and should not be recorded as a determination. This is sometimes called "verified type status".

A *type status identification* on the other hand is a secondary source for the type status, and is typically written on a label that is attached to a specimen. For a type status identification (as opposed to type status designation) it is fine to record any type status, even ones that are not sanctioned by the nomenclatural codes (e.g. "topotype" or "allotype"). Because of the similarities between type status identifications and taxonomic identifications, both are here been treated as determinations. In fact, if a taxon name is included in the type status identification, it may also be considered as an implicit taxonomic identification.

The outcome of the determination is in most cases a *taxon name* (that may be either scientific or vernacular). What *taxon* (i.e. taxon concept) the person intended with the determination is often difficult or even impossible to know, and has little relevance for collection management. It is usually sufficient to match the taxon name from the latest determination to the taxon concepts in the local classification currently used for the collection.
