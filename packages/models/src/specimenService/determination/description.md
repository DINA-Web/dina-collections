### Definition

A statement about a specimen's taxon name and/or type status, which is not itself a type status designation.

### Note(s)

A type status designation is understood here as an explicit or implicit designation of a new type status for a specimen with respect to a taxon name. A type status designation is made in a publication and is strictly regulated by a nomenclatural code. A taxonomic identification on the other hand is usually written on a label attached to a specimen, but could also be found in e.g. a publication or in a notebook stored at a different location.
