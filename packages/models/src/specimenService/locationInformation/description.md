# locationInformation

Information about the place of an event.


## Short description

Information about the place of an event.


### Definition

Information pertaining to a specific location.


### Examples

### Notes

This term is for keeping general information about a location, for example geographic coordinates or verbatim information about the location.

More specifically, the purpose of the term is:

1. to keep information about a location that is specific for an event (e.g., transcribed information about the location),
2. to keep information regarding the uncertainty about a location,
3. to describe how a location relates to some other place ("3 km NW of"), and
4. to document the source for some information (so that interpretations can be traced).
