# originInformation

Information about the physical or genetic origin of an [individual](__DOCLINK__individual/). This could for example be information on where an individual previously lived. The information may be associated with an [event](__DOCLINK__event/).


## Short description

Information about the origin of an individual.


### Defintion
Information pertaining to the origin of an [individual](__DOCLINK__individual/).


### Example

An [individual](__DOCLINK__individual/) may have more than one [event](__DOCLINK__event/) connected with origin information. For example: a lion first lived in Africa (origin event 1), then was placed in a Zoo in Europe (origin event 2), and finally escaped into the wild (origin event 3) where it was later killed and collected (death and collecting event).


### Notes

The purpose of this term is to keep information that has to do with the origin of [individuals](__DOCLINK__individual/). This could involve both the genetic and the physical origin. This term concerns the origin of individuals, not the provenance of specimens. The general description of the origin event, like its time and location, should be recorded under [event](__DOCLINK__event/).
