# specimen

The "things" registered under the same catalog number.


## Short description

The "things" registered under the same catalog number.


### Defintion

The "things" registered under the same catalog number.


### Notes

This is a flexible concept that can be used differently depending on the collection type or the collection's cataloging practices. The purpose is to support different kinds of collections that would otherwise be difficult to fit within the same system. For example, a specimen may in some collections correspond to a single physical object, whereas other collections may treat multiple physical objects from the same gathering event or the same individual as one specimen.


### Examples

* A skin and a skeleton from the same squirrel recognized as one specimen. Hence, the specimen corresponds to an individual.
* A skin and a skeleton from the same squirrel recognized as two separate specimens. Hence, specimen corresponds to a physical object.
