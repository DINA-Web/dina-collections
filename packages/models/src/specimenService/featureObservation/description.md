## Short description

The data measured or noticed for some property by an agent.


### Definition

The data measured, collected, perceived or noticed for some property by an agent (e.g. a person or a machine).


### Examples

* When a curator measures the wingspan and the weight of a bird, this counts as two separate observations.
* A curator observes the color of a specimen.


### Notes

This term is currently used for features for an [individual](__DOCLINK__individual/). [Taxonomic determinations](__DOCLINK__determination/) is currently not included, although it might be in future. [CuratorialAssessments](__DOCLINK__curatorialAssessment/) apply to [collectionItems](__DOCLINK__collectionItem/) and are consequently treated as a separate concept.
