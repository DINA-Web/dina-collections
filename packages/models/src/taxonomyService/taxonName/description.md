# taxonName

A name of a taxon (at any rank) that may be either a scientific name or a vernacular name.


## Short description

A scientific or vernacular name of a taxon.


### Definition

A scientific or vernacular name of a [taxon](__DOCLINK__taxon/) at any rank.


### Examples

* "Phoca hispida" (species)
* "Phocidae" (family)


### Notes

Scientific names do not have to be validly published according to a nomenclatural code. It is for example often desirable to use informal names for managing taxonomic groups that are poorly known. For the purpose of collection management, one often want to be pragmatic regarding the use of taxon names.

A taxon name may or may not be associated with a [taxon](__DOCLINK__taxon/).
