# taxon

A taxonomic group of any rank, such as a species or family, or class used to keep information about a locally used taxon concept.


## Short description

A taxonomic group of any rank, such as a species or family.


### Definition

A taxonomic group of any rank, such as a species, family, or class.


### Examples

The species that includes the type specimen for the name "Pusa hispida", which may also be referred to by the synonym "Phoca hispida".


### Notes

The purpose of this term is to keep information about locally used taxon concepts. These concepts do not have to be used elsewhere. The local classification is the combination of all the names and their relations. In the local classification, each taxon has an accepted taxon name at same rank as the taxon (more precisely, the taxon gets its rank from the accepted name). The accepted name may have synonyms at any rank.
