# dateRange

The start and end dates of a period and all the dates in between.

## Short description

A range between two dates.


### Notes

A date range can be used to describe the temporal extension of an event (e.g. the exact start and end dates of a field trip) or to describe the uncertainty about the timing of an event (e.g. a collecting event that took place some time between the years 1800 and 1810).
