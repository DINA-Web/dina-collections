# type

Type is used to describe resource objects that share common attributes and relationships. In combination with a resource [id](__DOCLINK__id) it identifies a single unique resource. This concept is important for the functioning of the system, but less so for understanding the data model at a higher level.

For more information, see the [JSON:API documentation](https://jsonapi.org/format/#document-resource-object-identification).
