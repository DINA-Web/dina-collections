# legacyData

Custom data from a previous system that do not fit elsewhere in the data model.


## Short description

Custom data that do not fit elsewhere in the data model.


### Definition

Data from a previous system which do not have a proper destination elsewhere in the data model.


### Examples

* An invalid collecting date, for example 2019-02-30.
* Mixed content that for some reason was not cleaned up prior to import into the system.


### Notes

Legacy data is treated as read-only data. It can be in any JSON format, but is normally added as an unordered list of nameâ€“value pairs.
