# datePart

A reference to a particular day represented within a calendar system.

## Short description

A reference to a day within a calendar system.


### Notes

The name is a bit problematic for two reasons:

* It is possible to store a full date, not just a partial date as the name implies
* It is possible to store a full timestamp (not just year, month and day)
