# storageLocation

A space for storing [physicalObjects](__DOCLINK__physicalObject/) in a collection.


## Short description

A dedicated space for storing physical objects.


### Definition

A dedicated space, at any level in a hierarchy, for storing one or more [physicalObjects](__DOCLINK__physicalObject/) in a collection.


### Examples

* "room 123"
* "Swedish Coleoptera"
* "the bone room"


### Notes

A storage location is usually a fixed space (like a room, shelf or cabinet) but could also be a "floating location". This latter kind is especially common when objects are sorted by taxonomy. Instead of having a fixed physical position are floating storage locations placed in relation to other storage locations nearby. For example, the objects representing the genus *Phoca* may be placed after those of *Pagophilus*, but before those of *Pusa*. Storage locations may be arranged in a hierarchy, irrespective of whether they have fixed positions or not.
