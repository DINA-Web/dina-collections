# physicalObject

The smallest recognized physical "thing" in the collection. Typical examples are a skin preparation and a herbarium sheet. A physical object represents one or more [collectionItems](__DOCLINK__collectionItem/).


## Short description

The smallest recognized physical "thing" in the collection.


### Definition

The smallest recognized physical "thing" in the collection.


### Examples

* A herbarium sheet with three plants mounted on it (possibly three collection items)
* A mounted skin of a squirrel (one [collectionItem](__DOCLINK__collectionItem/))
* A jar with two fishes (possibly two [collectionItems](__DOCLINK__collectionItem/))
* A tree branch with two birds mounted on it (possibly two [collectionItems](__DOCLINK__collectionItem/))


### Notes

The physical object is the physical thing that you do something with when you manage your collection. This could for example be the thing stored on the shelf, sent on loan or received from a donator. Physical objects change over time. Imagine for example a jar of 5 fishes first treated as one physical object "A". In response to a loan request, a new physical object "B" is created with one of the fishes and sent to the borrower. When the loan is returned, the fish is put back into the original container ("A"), thereby ending the existence of object "B".
