### Definition

One or more individuals with a single set of individual characteristics.

### Example(s)

* A specific squirrel represented by both a skin and a tissue sample in a collection.
* Three fishes in a jar of alcohol, coming from the same collecting event and representing the same taxon may be treated as a single group of individuals.

### Note(s)

Individual is understod in a broad sense and should be applied within its context. Thus, it should be possible to talk about individuals in for example a mineralogical collection.

This should perhaps be renamed "individualOrGroup" or just "individual".
