This documentation site is mainly targeted at developers who are working with,
or about to start working with, DINA-Collections. This means we assume the
reader has knowledge of Node, React, Redux and more. If you need to learn more
about JavaScript and the technologies used in our stack, you can go to
[DINA-School](https://github.com/DINA-Web/dina-school).

Our code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DINA-Web/dina-collections) and
we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy the services.

There are different ways to run DINA-Collections, either partly or fully with
Docker. For development, we recommend setting up the
[backend](./packages/backend/index.md) and [ui](./packages/ui/index.md) to run
locally (not in Docker), as it enables live reload/restart on changes in the
code.
