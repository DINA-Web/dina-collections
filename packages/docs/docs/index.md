This documentation site is mainly targeted at developers who are working with,
or about to start working with, DINA-Collections.

Our code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/DINA-Web/dina-collections) and
we use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy the services.

There are different ways to run DINA-Collections, either partly or fully with
Docker. For development, we recommend setting up the
[backend](./packages/backend/index.md) and [ui](./packages/ui/index.md) to run
locally (not in Docker), as it enables live reload/restart on changes in the
code.
