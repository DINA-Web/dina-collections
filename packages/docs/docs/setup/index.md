DINA Collections can be setup in different ways.

Either the system can be run fully with docker or partly with docker. When
running partly with docker all services but the API (backend) and UI (frontend)
is run in docker. Running the API and UI outside docker is preferred when doing
development.

Below follow guides for setting up the system in the different variations. They
assumes you have `git` installed

- [Setup locally for development](./setup-locally-for-development.md)
- [Setup locally with docker](./setup-locally-with-docker.md)
