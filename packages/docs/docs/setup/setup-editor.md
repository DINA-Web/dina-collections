Here are some links that may be useful when you want to configure your editor:

- [Syntax highlighting](http://babeljs.io/docs/editors)
- [ESLint editor setup](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations)
- [Prettier editor setup](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html)

If you use the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor, then you might
want to configure it like [this](https://youtu.be/YIvjKId9m2c) to avoid
conflicts between ESLint and Prettier.
