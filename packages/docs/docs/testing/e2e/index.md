We use [Cypress](https://cypress.io/) for e2e tests. Here are some useful links
to get started writing cypress tests:

- [Cypress API](https://docs.cypress.io/api/api/table-of-contents.html)
- [Cypress commands sorted by purpose](https://example.cypress.io/)
- [Example tests](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/tree/develop/packages/example/cypress/integration/examples)
- [Best practices](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/best-practices.html)

We also use
[cypress-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/cypress-testing-library)
to enable the same kind of selectors as in
[react-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/react-testing-library)
(they are both based on
[dom-testing-library](https://github.com/kentcdodds/dom-testing-library)).
