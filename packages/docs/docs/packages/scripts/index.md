The script package contains various scripts used by the application. These
scripts are exposed through the [cli](../../development/cli).

The scripts are divided into 2 folders - js and bash which contains scripts
written in either js or bash. The js scripts should only be run from a dev
environment while the bash scripts can be run on any environment.
