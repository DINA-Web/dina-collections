2. Test everything but api and ui in docker
3. Test load data locally with docker
4. test keycloak through docker






ENV cleanup
* Dont use .local env files


README
* Fix inconsistancies in auth url (sufix with auth or not)

Developer new feature
1. create new branch anton/feature-to-implement
2. developer submits pull request and target master
3. Travis runs tests (basically current travis file without after success)
4. If branch is up to date with master and tests are passing someone can merge it into master through github interface

Developer new version
1. Developer check out master
2. Developer run version script
  * in preversion hook run application test tests + bash script that ensures that git is clean and branch is up to date with remote?
  * "native" version behavior (pick patch, minor or major)
  * in postversion script git push and git push --tags
3. Travis detects a push with tags(http://grailsblog.objectcomputing.com/posts/2016/10/03/how-to-use-travis-to-build-and-deploy-your-plugin.html) and run build script (put build script in separate bash file). Use git tag as version

Deploy specific version
1. Developer run script locally (different for stage and production) and enters wanted version. The script ssh into correct machine and fetches latest docker versions and run script that restart the servers


scripts (put in ./scripts)
- ensure-master-is-clean.sh
- build-docker.sh (or .js if implemented in node)
- deploy.sh
- service-status.sh
- service-status-remote.sh (use servie-status)
- deploy-remote.sh (use deploy) (https://github.com/mafintosh/ssh-exec)
