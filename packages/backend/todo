Search

Implement dropdown component for searching for specific tag
* Talk to anton before
* Should be used at least for storage and taxonomy
1. Implement specification -> Very similar to checkboxSpecification but only work on 1 tag
2. Implement search component -> Need to do an initial fetch like the search checkbox component and then build options. Could also make sense to look at MultipleSearchTagsSelect/TagTypeFilterInlineDropdown. Likely similar props will be needed like the free text and default value option.
3. Add where needed like at taxonomy and storage

Implement new feature range component
* Talk to anton before
* For weight and length
* As it is now range and length dont have any specific components but just the specification
* A new component is needed to enable only matching for the selected type
* Should be quite straight forward to reuse TagTypeFilterInlineDropdown in a new FeatureRangeComponent
* the specification factory needs to be adjusted to forward the type in the queries. the value should be available in sectionValues
>>>>>>> 8326fc3... [BACKEND] Update todo

Add new checkbox for appearance and selective breeding





How does search work?
1. Create a queryBuilder using coreModules/search/utilities/queryBuilderFactory
* As input  querySpecifications which is located in each filter section is used by calling factories from search module



* Search
* 
** Implement multipleTagRefine


Search todo
* make queryBuilder accept arrays in the array and dont spread in all individual querySpecifications


Scripts
* rm-data-files
* create-data-files-from-sample
* import-data-from-files
* import-data-from-sample-files

* deploy-docker.sh
* deploy-docker-migrate.sh
* deploy-docker-import-from-sample.sh
* deploy-docker-import-from-files.sh

Checks (variable in env files)
* allowDropDatabaseOnMigrations (use to check if drop database is to be run)


Todo
* Update scripts and script envs to reflect updates
* create script that prints info for all servers.
* Remove

Servers
* demo (current alpha)
** migration strategy: docker:import-from-sample

* test (now used as stage)
** migration strategy: docker:import-from-sample

* stage (new)
** migration strategy: docker:migrate:latest

* production
** migration strategy: docker:migrate:latest

* local

changelog
* 



Order with new data
* 1. create-pr-with-sample-data + add data to correct servers - transport in zip to all servers
* 2. dev tests with data locally
* 3. dev unzipps in the correct servers
* 4. dev do deploystuff
* 5. dev call yarn docker:import-from-sample, docker:import-from-files, yarn docker:migrate depending on env

* 
** Implement multipleTagRefine

NEXT YEAR
* Implement delete for relationships
* Implement ensure user in controller + fix event row to not have admin as default
* Separate tree items from list items in resource manager. Dont fetch stuff all the time. Use count to check if need to refetch
* Merge resource manager and mammals

Code improvements ideas:
* Use deep diff on json api client with original item to check what to update.
* Make __ROOT__ references point to both resource and id, type object (to allow for required)
* Ensure consistancies in script names ex start:dev build:trees
* Upgrade react, webpack, cra
* Use styleguidist or storybook
* Refactor api clients -> use same in fe and in be
* Components and hocs on module root layer should only contain stuff that is supposed to be exported
* Create hoc for field that is only used in dev or test mode to ensure that field is registered in spec
* Create factories for different types of test for different inputs.
** wrapped in field
** data as integer, boolean, array and what not
* Find good division for general components. Use commonUI Layout or some other module
* In general make navigating folder structures logical
* Use same config setup in frontend and backend
* Potentially remove the apps scoping and only have app
* Determine what should be displayed in storybook


IMPORTANT
* Add all catalog numbers as part of migrations
* Add them as part of migrating specimens
* Add validations to centralized model
* Ensure not possible to run migrations by mistake


TODO
* remove diff
* remove schemaCompliant
* rewrite api tests
* Dra in latest version of data
** use serviceInteractor
** create layer to sync models


Developing a data-model version
1. update model
2. build schema (will be a candidate)
3. add model version migration
5. write migrationFunctions for data up and down
6. run migrations

Build new docker version
1. On master branch run npm version patch, minor, major


Testing a new deploy
1. fetch production db
2. pull latest containers
3. start api and worker
(ensure no edits)
4. run migrations
5. ensure data


For deploy new version
1. pull latest containers
2. restart api and worker (edits unavilable)
3. run migrations
4. api and worker edits available


In Common

* Possible to dump remote db through docker exec?
