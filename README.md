# DINA Collections

DINA Collections is an open-source web-based information management system for
natural history data. The system is under development.

At the core of the system is support for assembling, managing and sharing data
associated with natural history collections and their curation ("collection
management"). Target collections include zoological, botanical, geological and
paleontological collections, living collections, biodiversity inventories,
observation records, and molecular data. DINA Collections is primarily intended
for large installations servicing the collection management needs of a country,
a region, or a large institution.
